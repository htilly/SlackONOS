## Submission Notes

### What Makes SlackONOS Unique?

1. **True Democracy:** Unlike other music bots that use command-based voting, SlackONOS uses intuitive emoji reactions for seamless voting.

2. **Gong Ban System:** Tracks that get "gonged" (voted down) become temporarily immune to re-queuing, preventing trolling.

3. **Multi-Platform:** First bot to support both Discord and Slack simultaneously on the same Sonos system.

4. **Self-Hosted:** No data leaves your server. Perfect for privacy-conscious organizations.

5. **AI Integration:** Natural language processing makes adding music feel like talking to a DJ, not a computer.

### Target Audience

- **Gaming Communities:** Discord servers that want shared music during gaming sessions
- **Remote Teams:** Companies using Discord for team communication
- **Co-working Spaces:** Shared offices with Sonos speakers
- **Streamers:** Content creators who want community-controlled music
- **Music Enthusiasts:** Any group that wants fair, democratic music selection
