[
Oops, my finger slipped!
I’m doing this for everyone’s sake.
Let’s pretend that never happened.
Next! Because we deserve better.
Even silence is better than this.
I’m saving your ears from bleeding.
We’ll just call that a momentary lapse in judgment.
Who hurt you? Because this song did.
What was that noise? Oh, just this song.
Next song, please. My dignity demands it.
Nobody needs to suffer through that.
Wow, that was aggressively mediocre.
Why does this even exist?
Do we really need to subject ourselves to this?
Goodbye, forever!
What kind of monster added this?
That was a cry for help in song form.
Did a cat walk across the keyboard to make that?
For the love of music, let's move on.
That was less music and more torture.
I’m sorry, I can’t do that to us.
Music shouldn’t feel like a punishment.
This song just committed a crime against humanity.
Can we just skip the part where we suffer?
Please tell me that was a joke.
I refuse to acknowledge this as music.
This is why aliens won’t visit us.
Whoever added this owes us an apology.
Sorry, my ears have standards.
This song belongs in the bin.
That was… unpleasant.
Consider that song permanently banned.
What in the name of bad taste was that?
Even the skip button winced.
Why does this song exist to torment us?
Is this some kind of cruel joke?
We deserve better. Skipping.
No one asked for that.
That was more painful than stepping on a LEGO.
This song is now dead to me.
Just doing my duty as a responsible human.
Let’s spare everyone the misery.
I’m not enduring that for another second.
And we’re moving on… quickly.
Who greenlit this atrocity?
Let’s never speak of this again.
Someone, somewhere owes me an apology.
I’d rather listen to a dial-up modem.
I refuse to put up with this.
This song is a violation of the Geneva Convention.
Consider this a mercy kill.
This song belongs on a Do Not Play list.
It’s not you, it’s… actually, it’s you.
Next track, for the love of all things decent.
That was a crime against eardrums.
Why do bad songs happen to good people?
Skipping for the sake of humanity.
Let's not subject ourselves to that.
That song was pure suffering.
Is there a fine for playing this?
I'd rather endure a root canal.
Moving on before I lose faith in music.
That was less music, more noise pollution.
We are NOT doing that again.
Let’s pretend this never happened.
My soul just cringed.
I think I just aged ten years.
Deleting that from my memory.
Why is this even an option?
This song is an offense to all senses.
That was almost impressively bad.
Can we all agree to never play that again?
That song is now on my enemies list.
Let's not put ourselves through that.
My ears are officially in protest.
Whoever added that should be ashamed.
Why does this feel like a personal attack?
Skipping this before it does more damage.
That was not a vibe.
Did a toddler compose this?
This is why we can’t have nice things.
I’d rather sit in silence.
Who’s idea was this?
That was more annoying than a mosquito.
Music should make you feel, not suffer.
We’re better than this.
I didn't sign up for this.
Skipping for the sake of my sanity.
That song just ruined my mood.
Let’s not do that again.
Why does this feel like a punishment?
That song just tried to kill the vibe.
Even my skip button is disgusted.
Is this supposed to be music?
Skipping before it gets worse.
Let's all agree to forget that happened.
That was not worth the trauma.
This is why I have trust issues.
I’d rather hear nails on a chalkboard.
Skipping this travesty.
